START:
// Debugged line 10 in BishopMoveTests.java to see where it'd throw an exception

ChessBoard.java:
Added "board" 2d array to ChessBoard for storage of pieces

ChessPosition.java:
Selected "(int row, int col)" in class ChessPosition to "Bind constructor parameters to fields"
    This added a private final int for the row and column
Quickly fixed the getters and setters

ChessBoard.java:

Made package movesets, one for each piece.
Current goal: to return a list of possible moves for the bishop

ChessBoard.java:
import chess.ChessPiece.PieceType;
import chess.ChessGame.TeamColor;
This way I can use the enums in ChessPiece and ChessGame

Give all Chess classes a hash and equals function
Give ChessMove and ChessPosition a toString function
(These can be generated by right clicking anywhere in the code and selecting "Generate")
